Belly Button Biodiversity
This assignment explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset with an interactive dashboard that catalogs the microbies found on human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
